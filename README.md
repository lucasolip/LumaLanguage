# Luma Language
Compiler for a personal programming language I call Luma, for a project from university subject _Language Processors_. Made using Flex, Bison and the C programming language.
The compiler/interpreter is written in C, and compiles Luma code into Q code. Q is a pseudo-assembly language based in C designed by my teacher.
